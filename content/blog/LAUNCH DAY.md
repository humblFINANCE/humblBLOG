# Today is the day.
Today is the day that I put my work out into the public eye. Today is the day I had decided to publish my software regardless of its progress and completion. Today is the day I am making [humblFINANCE](https://humblfinance.io) public.

Check our official launch on October 2nd!

Here are two interactive demos for a humblFINANCE quick-start if you don't feel like reading:

# Why [humblFINANCE](https://humblfinance.io/)?
I am not a financial guy. I didn't know the first thing to do when I wanted to "invest" my money. I didn't know what data to look at, I didn't know who to listen to for advice or guidance on the subject, I didn't know the tools available to regular investors like myself. All I knew is that I wanted to be able to invest my money and put it aside without having to worry about losing it all. So the journey began. I'm not writing today to tell you about that journey, but I'm here today to tell you about the result of that journey. I've lost money in the market, had a couple accounts go to zero, but embedded deep in those experiences were some lessons that I kept building on to achieve what I believe is possible; a shallow learning curve for regular investors, knows as retail traders in the financial world (bc I'm a financial guy now) to take advantage of the ever increasing value of the US stock market. 

A few years later and considerable amount of hours spent learning how to invest properly, I am sitting +120% up on the year invested in only 2 stocks, and no it's not $NVDA (although I wish it was). Granted, this is a small account, it won't change my life, but it is a tangible result that the time I had spent combing through the noise was beginning to show its value. Dialing in this process was proof you don't need to pay someone to tell you what they think they know, and you really can just look at some numbers, and get a good grasp of how our economy is functioning and where you should put your money to take advantage of that. 

Now I'm aware that not everyone likes to look at numbers. So I figured, to give people the opportunity to fast-forward their understanding of "investing" with a lot less of the friction than I did, I could help them. I could distill my journey of discovery into a couple simple graphs to make the economy turn from numbers to colors. So that's where **humblFINANCE** comes in.

# What is humblFINANCE?
This is the 4th revision of a piece of software that I have built that I think is capable of doing just that, turning numbers into colors to make a robust investing strategy available to everyone. humblFINANCE was originally born in excel, but I quickly came to dislike that platform. Then I moved to R (a data scientist programming language), that got me a little closer to my goal, but not close enough. Then onto Python, I started to see humblFINANCE take shape, but I needed just a little more. Now built on a modern web language, Nextjs, humblFINANCE has matured into a fully featured web and mobile website. I've learned a lot about software development, but that story is for another day.

 Now, when looking at the dashboard today, you'll still see some numbers -- but I am going to be rolling out a bunch of updates over the next 2 months to really simplify things, but still leave the lid open to those who want to look at and interact with the data underneath. 

It is a guided investment strategy platform where you can look at the *real* health of the economy in one glance, have the best sectors to invest in shown to you, and monitor individual companies in those sectors to add to your portfolio

**humblFINANCE is a single point of entry to financial markets**, offering aÂ streamlined approachÂ to navigating financialÂ markets. OurÂ platform providesÂ aÂ clear, real-time snapshotÂ of the economy's health, guiding you towardsÂ the most promising investmentÂ sectors. With humblFINANCE, you can effortlessly monitorÂ individual companies within theseÂ high-potentialÂ sectors, enablingÂ you to makeÂ informed un-opinionated decisions aboutÂ portfolioÂ additions. WhetherÂ you're a seasoned investor or just starting out, humblFINANCE empowers you withÂ the tools and knowledge toÂ confidently build and optimize your investment portfolio, allÂ fromÂ a single, user-friendly platform.

Expect frequent updates and improvements over the coming months. There is still a lot to do.
# Thank you
It would mean a lot if you share the website with anyone who you think could benefit from a platform like this. I want to get this out there and get the necessary feedback form people to improve upon it, and today is the day for that to start.
